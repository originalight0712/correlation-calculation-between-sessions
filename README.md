main file can be used directly if changing the file address correctly, this code can be used to visualize STRF of neuron response, ripple transfer function, extract temporal distribution, frequency distribution and 
ripple transfer function of neuron response. Then the calculation result of correlation coefficients of neurons in the same session will be shown in depth. 

All the example data is uploaded to folder 0620, access the files in main file and run the code, the result will be shown.
