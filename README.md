main.py can be used directly if changing the file address correctly, this code can be used to visualize STRF of neuron response, ripple transfer function, extract temporal distribution, frequency distribution and 
ripple transfer function of neuron response. Then the calculation result of correlation coefficients of neurons in the same session will be shown in depth.
